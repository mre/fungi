So now we have a dungeon full of monsters and scrolls, but it's still
somewhat lacking in variety. Where are all the swords, shields, staves
and so on?

We need equipment. It differs from the items we have in two ways: you
can only equip it in limited slots and it enhances your abilities
while it's being worn. This is unlike our items which are one-use-only (though
they don't have to be!).

== Basic equipment

Let's create an `Equipment` component. It will know whether it's
equipped or not and it will also have a `slot` such as "hand" for
weapons or "head" for helmets.

[source]
----
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize)]
/// An object that can be equipped, yielding bonuses.
struct Equipment {
    slot: Slot,
    equipped: bool,
}

#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize)]
enum Slot {
    LeftHand,
    RightHand,
    Head,
}
----

NOTE: We're using `enum` for the equipment slots to stay safe from
typos and forgetting to handle a new case in a `match`. You can just
use a string instead, though.

We'll add this new component to our `Object` and its `new` method:

[source]
----
struct Object {
    ...
    equipment: Option<Equipment>,
}


impl Object {
    pub fn new(x: i32, y: i32, char: char, name: &str, color: Color, blocks: bool) -> Self {
        Object {
            ...
            equipment: None,
        }
    }
    ...
}
----

And let's add a couple of new `Object` methods for putting the
equipment on and off:

[source]
----
/// Equip object and show a message about it
pub fn equip(&mut self, log: &mut Vec<(String, Color)>) {
    if self.item.is_none() {
        log.add(format!("Can't equip {:?} because it's not an Item.", self),
                colors::RED);
        return
    };
    if let Some(ref mut equipment) = self.equipment {
        if !equipment.equipped {
            equipment.equipped = true;
            log.add(format!("Equipped {} on {:?}.", self.name, equipment.slot),
                    colors::LIGHT_GREEN);
        }
    } else {
        log.add(format!("Can't equip {:?} because it's not an Equipment.", self),
                colors::RED);
    }
}
----

The meat of the method is in its middle: we take the equipment
component, mark its `equipped` value as true and print a message. The
checks before and after are there to make sure that the `Object` we're
calling is indeed an `Equipment` and also an `Item`.

We could just ignore that since all equipments should be items (i.e.
they can be carried in the inventory and dropped on the floor), it's
better to see when the unexpected happens.

Dequip works similarly:

[source]
----
/// Dequip object and show a message about it
pub fn dequip(&mut self, log: &mut Vec<(String, Color)>) {
    if self.item.is_none() {
        log.add(format!("Can't dequip {:?} because it's not an Item.", self),
                colors::RED);
        return
    };
    if let Some(ref mut equipment) = self.equipment {
        if equipment.equipped {
            equipment.equipped = false;
            log.add(format!("Dequipped {} from {:?}.", self.name, equipment.slot),
                    colors::LIGHT_YELLOW);
        }
    } else {
        log.add(format!("Can't dequip {:?} because it's not an Equipment.", self),
                colors::RED);
    }
}
----

NOTE: You may have noticed that we're passing the message log
(`Vec<(String, Color)>`) directly instead of the full `Game` struct
like in other `Object` methods such as `attack` or `take_damage`. This
is to avoid a double mutable borrow later. Try passing `game: &mut
Game` here instead and you'll see the problem when we get to
`toggle_equip`.

How do we equip our items? We can rely on the existing `Item`
mechanism -- when you try to "use" or "cast" an equipment (which you
can do since it's an `Item`, too), we'll equip or unequip it.

First, let's add a new Item type:

[source]
----
enum Item {
    Heal,
    Lightning,
    Confuse,
    Fireball,
    Equipment,
}
----

NOTE: We'll just group all equipments under a single item type. We can
always split them out later.

Then in the callback match in `use_item`:

[source]
----
let on_use: ... = match item {
    Heal => cast_heal,
    Lightning => cast_lightning,
    Fireball => cast_fireball,
    Confuse => cast_confuse,
    Equipment => toggle_equipment,
}
----

We have to create the `toggle_equipment` function:

[source]
----
fn toggle_equipment(inventory_id: usize, _objects: &mut [Object], game: &mut Game, _tcod: &mut Tcod)
             -> UseResult
{
    let equipment = match game.inventory[inventory_id].equipment {
        Some(equipment) => equipment,
        None => return UseResult::Cancelled,
    };
    if equipment.equipped {
        game.inventory[inventory_id].dequip(&mut game.log);
    } else {
        game.inventory[inventory_id].equip(&mut game.log);
    }
    UseResult::UsedAndKept
}
----

We're returning a new `UseResult` value here: one that says we have
used the item (so it's the monsters' turn now), but we don't want the
item to disappear!

NOTE: Here is why we have to pass `&mut game.log` to `equip` instead
of the full `&mut game`: in the same statement we look up the
equipment Object in `game.inventory`, which will make `game` mutably
borrowed for the duration of the `equip` call. So we can't borrow it
second time. However, since we're only borrowing `game.inventory`, we
_can_ borrow `game.log` separately! If you don't like this, you could
turn the `equip` and `dequip` methods into standalone functions that
would take `inventory_id` and `&mut game`.

We need to add the new value to the `UseResult` enum and handle the
new case in `use_item` (as always, the compiler will complain so you
can rely on it to tell you where to look):

[source]
----
match on_use(inventory_id, objects, game, tcod) {
    UseResult::UsedUp => {
        ...
    }
    UseResult::UsedAndKept => {}, // do nothing
    UseResult::Cancelled => {
        ...
    }
}
----

And hey! Now we can have regular items that don't disappear upon use
-- such as wands, spellbooks, lockpicks, etc.

Finally, we need to update the item chances for this new
`Equipment` type and add one to the game!

Add this to the `item_chances` in `place_objects`:

[source]
----
Weighted {weight: 1000, item: Item::Equipment},
----

And then this sword later on where we generate the items:

[source]
----
Item::Equipment => {
    // create a sword
    let mut object = Object::new(x, y, '/', "sword", colors::SKY, false);
    object.item = Some(Item::Equipment);
    object.equipment = Some(Equipment{equipped: false, slot: Slot::RightHand});
    object
}
----

As you can see, the weighted chances really don't have to be
percentages. By setting the sword's value to `1000`, it's much more
likely to appear than any other item so we can find it early in the game
and test it!

We will set it back to something more reasonable later on.


== Equipment polish

Now that we have the equipment basics in place, let's finish it up.
First, we only want to have one item equipped in any given slot.
Here's a function that returns an equipment that occupies a given slot
(if it exists):

[source]
----
fn get_equipped_in_slot(slot: Slot, inventory: &[Object]) -> Option<usize> {
    for (inventory_id, item) in inventory.iter().enumerate() {
        if item.equipment.as_ref().map_or(false, |e| e.equipped && e.slot == slot) {
            return Some(inventory_id)
        }
    }
    None
}
----

We can use it to prevent a second item in the same slot, or better
yet: dequip the old item to make room for the new one. In
`toggle_equipment`:

[source]
----
// if the slot is already being used, dequip whatever is there first
if let Some(old_equipment) = get_equipped_in_slot(equipment.slot, &game.inventory) {
    game.inventory[old_equipment].dequip(&mut game.log);
}
----

Another nice behavior is to automatically equip picked up items, if
their slots are available. In the `pick_item_up` function, in the
`else` branch:

[source]
----
let item = objects.swap_remove(object_id);
game.log.add(format!("You picked up a {}!", item.name), colors::GREEN);
let index = game.inventory.len();
let slot = item.equipment.map(|e| e.slot);
game.inventory.push(item);

// automatically equip, if the corresponding equipment slot is unused
if let Some(slot) = slot {
    if get_equipped_in_slot(slot, &game.inventory).is_none() {
        game.inventory[index].equip(&mut game.log);
    }
}
----

We take the inventory index of the picked up item and an `Option` of
the equipment slot (it's `None` if the item is not an equipment).

Then we check whether that slot is occupied, and if not, equip the new
item.

We also need to de-equip an item if we're dropping it. In `drop_item`
right after the `game.inventory.remove` line:

[source]
----
if item.equipment.is_some() {
    item.dequip(&mut game.log);
}
----

It would also be nice if we could show which items are equipped in the
inventory screen. Replace the `inventory.iter().map(...)` line in
`inventory_menu` with:

[source]
----
inventory.iter().map(|item| {
    // show additional information, in case it's equipped
    match item.equipment {
        Some(equipment) if equipment.equipped => {
            format!("{} (on {:?})", item.name, equipment.slot)
        }
        _ => item.name.clone()
    }
}).collect()
----

We just replace the closure passed to `map` to report the equipped
slot if available and the item name otherwise.

You can check the equipment's state in the inventory screen, and it
changes correctly as you pick up, drop, equip and dequip various
items!

One last thing to do here: the message log shows the equipment slot as
capitalised:

----
Equipped sword on RightHand.
----

This is because the slots are enums and this is their `Debug`
representation -- if they didn't have `#[derive(Debug)]`, we wouldn't
be able to print them at all.

It would be nice if we could override the output somehow. Or better
yet, leave the debug output as is but provide a human-readable
alternative!

:display: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Display.html

The way to provide a user facing output in Rust is to implement the
{display}[Display] trait.

Let's give it a go:

[source]
----
impl std::fmt::Display for Slot {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut std::fmt::Formatter) -> std::fmt::Result {
        match *self {
            Slot::LeftHand => write!(f, "left hand"),
            Slot::RightHand => write!(f, "right hand"),
            Slot::Head => write!(f, "head"),
        }
    }
}
----

The `write!` macro is similar to `format!` or `println!` but it writes
to a `std::fmt::Formatter` struct.

We can now use this new formatting by replacing `{:?}` to `{}` every
time we print out a `Slot`. So in `inventory_menu`:

[source]
----
format!("{} (on {})", item.name, equipment.slot)
----

and then the "Equipped on" and "Dequipped on" messages in `equip` and `dequip`.

And now the equipment-related messages look much nicer!

== Bonus round

The last bit is to make equipment useful, by letting it change the
player's stats when equipped. We could simply add the bonus value to a
stat (say, attack power) when the item is equipped, and subtract it
when dequipped. This is brittle because any tiny mistake will
permanently change the player's stats!

A more reliable approach is to calculate on-the-fly the player's stats
when they are needed, based on the original stat and any bonuses. This
way there's no room for inconsistencies -- the stat is truly based on
whatever bonuses apply at the moment.

Other languages have different ways of dealing with this (e.g.
Python's properties), but in Rust we have to rely on functions and
methods.

We'll implement the `power` (attack) bonuses first and then do the
analogous work for `defense` and `HP`.

We'll create a `power` method on `Object` which will return the total
power of the object (player or a monster):

[source]
----
pub fn power(&self, game: &Game) -> i32 {
    let base_power = ...;
    let bonus = ...;
    base_power + bonus
}
----

So we get the base power of the object, then all the bonuses that apply
and add them together. Easy!

The base power is stored in the `Fighter` component, so we look it up
there and return `0` if the object doesn't have the component
(alternatively, you may return an error or an `Option<i32>`):

[source]
----
let base_power = self.fighter.map_or(0, |f| f.power);
----

The bonus is going to be a little more complicated: we want to go
through all the object's equipment and sum up their bonuses:

[source]
----
let bonus = self.get_all_equipped(game).iter().fold(0, |sum, e| sum + e.power_bonus);
----

This is a bit of a handful, so let us unpack it.

First, we'll have a method called `get_all_equipped` which returns all
equipment for the given object. Then we go through each equipment (using
`iter`) and sum up all their power bonuses.

:fold: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.fold

We use the {fold}[`fold` Iterator method] here to do the sum. Fold
(also called `reduce`) takes a starter argument (`0`) and runs the
closure on it and the first element from the iterator. The return
value is the new starter value for the next iterator element.

NOTE: Rust 1.11.0 will have a `sum` iterator method which just adds all
numbers from an iterator together (which could be easier to
understand), but at the time of this writing, it's not been
released.

Finally, the `Equipment` component needs to have the `power_bonus`
property!

So let's start there, then implement `get_all_equipped` and finally
switch to using the `power` method.

Extending the equipment is the easy part:

[source]
----
struct Equipment {
    slot: Slot,
    equipped: bool,
    power_bonus: i32,
}
----

By using `i32`, the bonuses can be negative, e.g. for cursed items.

When we try to compile it, Rust will remind us that we need to set the
power bonus for our sword in `place_objects`. Let's just use `0` for now:

[source]
----
object.equipment = Some(Equipment{equipped: false, slot: Slot::RightHand, power_bonus: 0});
----

Next, we'll add the `get_all_equipped` method:

[source]
----
/// returns a list of equipped items
pub fn get_all_equipped(&self, game: &Game) -> Vec<Equipment> {
    if self.name == "player" {
        game.inventory
            .iter()
            .filter(|item| {
                item.equipment.map_or(false, |e| e.equipped)
            })
            .map(|item| item.equipment.unwrap())
            .collect()
    } else {
        vec![]
    }
}
----

We go through the inventory filter out anything that's not an
equipment and then return a vector of equipments.

NOTE: The `if self.name == "player"` bit is a bit hacky. We have to do
it because player is the only object with an inventory. If we added
inventory to every object, or kept a unique ID associated with each
object, we wouldn't need to do this.

Anyway, we can calculate the full power value of each object, but
there's one more thing we ought to do. Remember that we now have a
`power` property as well as a `power` method. We should give them
distinct names so we know which is which when editing code. Let's
change `Fighter.power` to `Fighter.base_power`:

[source]
----
struct Fighter {
    // ...
    base_power: i32,
    // ...
}
----

And let's update our `power` method to use `base_power`:

[source]
----
pub fn power(&self, game: &Game) -> i32 {
    let base_power = self.fighter.map_or(0, |f| f.base_power);
    let bonus = self.get_all_equipped(game).iter().fold(0, |sum, e| sum + e.power_bonus);
    base_power + bonus
}
----


When we try to compile this, we'll see all the uses of `Fighter.power`
in our code! We can then go one by one and decide whether we need the
full or base power there.

First, we'll update the damage calculation in our `attack` method.
This:

[source]
----
let damage = self.fighter.map_or(0, |f| f.power) - target.fighter.map_or(0, |f| f.defense);
----

becomes:

[source]
----
let damage = self.power(game) - target.fighter.map_or(0, |f| f.defense);
----

Next, we have to change `power` to `base_power` in `place_objects`. From:

[source]
----
orc.fighter = Some(Fighter{max_hp: 20, hp: 20, defense: 0, power: 4, xp: 35,
                                               on_death: DeathCallback::Monster});
----

to:

[source]
----
orc.fighter = Some(Fighter{max_hp: 20, hp: 20, defense: 0, base_power: 4, xp: 35,
                                               on_death: DeathCallback::Monster});
----

And similarly for `troll`.

We want to show the full power in the character screen, so
`handle_keys` match arm for `c` will become:

[source]
----
let msg = format!("Character information

Level: {}
Experience: {}
Experience to level up: {}

Maximum HP: {}
Attack: {}
Defense: {}", level, fighter.xp, level_up_xp, fighter.max_hp, player.power(game), fighter.defense);  // <1>
----
<1> `fighter.power` -> `player.power(game)`

But the `level_up` screen should only show the base power:

[source]
----
choice = menu(
    "Level up! Choose a stat to raise:\n",
    &[format!("Constitution (+20 HP, from {})", fighter.max_hp),
      format!("Strength (+1 attack, from {})", fighter.base_power),  // <1>
      format!("Agility (+1 defense, from {})", fighter.defense)],
    LEVEL_SCREEN_WIDTH, &mut tcod.root);
----
<1> `fighter.power` -> `fighter.base_power`

And do the same a bit later on when we actually level up power:

[source]
----
1 => {
    fighter.base_power += 1;  // <1>
}
----
<1> `fighter.power` -> `fighter.base_power`

And finally, we need to player's `Fighter` component in `new_game`:

[source]
----
player.fighter = Some(Fighter{max_hp: 100, hp: 100, defense: 1, base_power: 4, xp: 0,  // <1>
                                  on_death: DeathCallback::Player});
----
<1> `fighter.power` -> `fighter.base_power`

Doing `defense` is exactly analogous: just rename `defense` to
`base_defense` in `Fighter`, add `defense_bonus` to `Equipment` and
fix the compilation errors.

[source]
----
pub fn defense(&self, game: &Game) -> i32 {
    let base_defense = self.fighter.map_or(0, |f| f.base_defense);
    let bonus = self.get_all_equipped(game).iter().fold(0, |sum, e| sum + e.defense_bonus);
    base_defense + bonus
}
----

For example, here's the final damage formula in `attack`:

[source]
----
let damage = self.power(game) - target.defense(game);
----


The case for `max_hp` is a little complicated by the fact that we use
it in more places (`heal` and `cast_heal`). The beginning is the same,
though: rename `max_hp` in `Fighter` to `base_max_hp`, add
`bonus_max_hp` to `Equipment` and update monsters and equipment in
`place_objects`.

So the final `Fighter` struct looks like this:

[source]
----
struct Fighter {
    hp: i32,
    base_max_hp: i32,
    base_defense: i32,
    base_power: i32,
    xp: i32,
    on_death: DeathCallback,
}
----

The `Equipment` struct:

[source]
----
struct Equipment {
    slot: Slot,
    equipped: bool,
    max_hp_bonus: i32,
    defense_bonus: i32,
    power_bonus: i32,
}
----

And the and `max_hp` method on `Object`:

[source]
----
pub fn max_hp(&self, game: &Game) -> i32 {
    let base_max_hp = self.fighter.map_or(0, |f| f.base_max_hp);
    let bonus = self.get_all_equipped(game).iter().fold(0, |sum, e| sum + e.max_hp_bonus);
    base_max_hp + bonus
}
----

We'll have to modify the `heal` method to pass in `Game`:

[source]
----
/// heal by the given amount, without going over the maximum
pub fn heal(&mut self, amount: i32, game: &Game) {  // <1>
    let max_hp = self.max_hp(game);  // <2>
    if let Some(mut fighter) = self.fighter {
        fighter.hp += amount;
        if fighter.hp > max_hp {  // <3>
            fighter.hp = max_hp;  // <4>
        }
    }
}
----
<1> Pass `&Game` because it's required by the `max_hp` method
<2> Get the maximum HP count including bonuses
<3> Use the `max_hp` variable here
<4> And here

And we need to fix `cast_heal` as well:

[source]
----
fn cast_heal(_inventory_id: usize, objects: &mut [Object], game: &mut Game, _tcod: &mut Tcod)
             -> UseResult
{
    // heal the player
    let player = &mut objects[PLAYER];
    if let Some(fighter) = player.fighter {
        if fighter.hp == player.max_hp(game) {  // <1>
            game.log.add("You are already at full health.", colors::RED);
            return UseResult::Cancelled;
        }
        game.log.add("Your wounds start to feel better!", colors::LIGHT_VIOLET);
        player.heal(HEAL_AMOUNT, game);  // <2>
        return UseResult::UsedUp;
    }
    UseResult::Cancelled
}
----
<1> check HP against the `max_hp` method
<2> `heal` requires `&Game` now

And the healing at the beginning of `next_level` is now:

[source]
----
let heal_hp = objects[PLAYER].max_hp(game) / 2;
objects[PLAYER].heal(heal_hp, game);
----

And that's it. The game should now compile, but we're not actually
using any bonuses! So let's fix that.

The values here are basically tuning the gameplay. Feel free to set them
to whatever you wish.

We'll set sword's `power_bonus` to `3` and leave the rest set to `0`.

Next, we'll add a shield which has a defense bonus of `1`.

Let's rename the `Equipment` item type to `Sword` and add a new one
called `Shield`:

[source]
----
enum Item {
    Heal,
    Lightning,
    Confuse,
    Fireball,
    Sword,  // <1>
    Shield,  // <2>
}
----
<1> `Equipment` -> `Sword`
<2> This is new

and in `use_item`:

[source]
----
let on_use: ... = match item {
    Heal => cast_heal,
    Lightning => cast_lightning,
    Confuse => cast_confuse,
    Fireball => cast_fireball,
    Sword => toggle_equipment,  // <1>
    Shield => toggle_equipment,  // <2>
};
----
<1> `Equipment` -> `Sword`
<2> This is new

And assign them chances in `place_objects`. We'll use our
`from_dungeon_level` method here to only show these items later in the game:

[source]
----
// item random table
let item_chances = &mut [
    // healing potion always shows up, even if all other items have 0 chance
    Weighted {weight: 35, item: Item::Heal},
    Weighted {weight: from_dungeon_level(&[Transition{level: 4, value: 25}], level),
              item: Item::Lightning},
    Weighted {weight: from_dungeon_level(&[Transition{level: 6, value: 25}], level),
              item: Item::Fireball},
    Weighted {weight: from_dungeon_level(&[Transition{level: 2, value: 10}], level),
              item: Item::Confuse},
    Weighted {weight: from_dungeon_level(&[Transition{level: 4, value: 5}], level),  // <1>
              item: Item::Sword},
    Weighted {weight: from_dungeon_level(&[Transition{level: 8, value: 15}], level),  // <2>
              item: Item::Shield},
];

<1> This replaces `Item::Equipment`
<2> This is new

and further down in the `match` expression we'll actually create the
shield:

[source]
----
Item::Shield => {
    // create a shield
    let mut object = Object::new(x, y, '[', "shield", colors::DARKER_ORANGE, false);
    object.item = Some(Item::Shield);
    object.equipment = Some(Equipment{equipped: false, slot: Slot::LeftHand, max_hp_bonus: 0, defense_bonus: 1, power_bonus: 0});
    object
}
----

And finally, let's give our player something to start with. They can't
go into the dungeon unarmed, after all!

So in `new_game` after we initialise the `Game` struct:

[source]
----
// initial equipment: a dagger
let mut dagger = Object::new(0, 0, '-', "dagger", colors::SKY, false);
dagger.item = Some(Item::Sword);
dagger.equipment = Some(Equipment {
    equipped: true,
    slot: Slot::LeftHand,
    max_hp_bonus: 0,
    defense_bonus: 0,
    power_bonus: 2
});
game.inventory.push(dagger);
----

But let's also decrease player's initial power to `2` since this _is_
a dungeon of doom after all!

[source]
----
player.fighter = Some(Fighter{base_max_hp: 100, hp: 100, base_defense: 1, base_power: 2, xp: 0,
                              on_death: DeathCallback::Player});
----

And that's it. We've got a bonus system that's generic enough for all
kinds of crazy equipment. So: play the game, add stuff, change stuff,
modify it to your heart's content or write something completely new
from scratch.

*Have fun!*
