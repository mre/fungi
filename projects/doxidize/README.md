# Doxidize

Doxidize is a new tool for writing documentation for your Rust projects.

## Status

We're still at a quite experimental phase here. Everything is subject to
change at any time. Even the approach Doxidize takes is quite new, and
different than Rust's current tooling.

## What does that mean?

As a tool written in Rust, Doxidize is dogfooded. For more details, please
[check out the online documentation]. If you would prefer to read them
locally, do this:

```shell
> git clone https://github.com/steveklabnik/doxidize
> cd doxidize
> cargo run -- build
> cargo run -- serve
```

And then view the docs in your web browser.
