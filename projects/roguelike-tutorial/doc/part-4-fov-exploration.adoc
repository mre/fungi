== Field of View (FOV)

The next step towards a complete roguelike is FOV. This adds a
tactical element, and lets the player wonder what's on the other side
of every door and every corner! The FOV works like a light source
where the player stands, casting light in every direction but not
getting past any walls. Regions in shadow are invisible. You could
code it yourself by casting rays outward from the player, but it's
much easier than that; libtcod has a whole module dedicated to it! It
includes different methods with varying levels of precision, speed and
other interesting properties. There's an {fov-study}[excellent study
here] if you want to know more about them, including tables and images
comparing the different algorithms.

We'll define the chosen algorithm along with some other constants so
they can be changed later. For now we'll just use the default
(`Basic`) algorithm. There's also an option to light walls or not;
this is a matter of preference. Another important constant is the
maximum radius for FOV calculations, how far the player can see in the
dungeon. (Whether this is due to the player's sight range or the light
from the player's torch depends on how you choose to explain this to
the player.)

[source,rust]
----
const FOV_ALGO: FovAlgorithm = FovAlgorithm::Basic;
const FOV_LIGHT_WALLS: bool = true;
const TORCH_RADIUS: i32 = 10;
----

And we need to add colours for the lit tiles:

[source,rust]
----
const COLOR_DARK_WALL: Color = Color { r: 0, g: 0, b: 100 };
const COLOR_LIGHT_WALL: Color = Color { r: 130, g: 110, b: 50 };
const COLOR_DARK_GROUND: Color = Color { r: 50, g: 50, b: 150 };
const COLOR_LIGHT_GROUND: Color = Color { r: 200, g: 180, b: 50 };
----

The fov map object in `tcod` is called `Map`, which conflicts with our
own dungeon map type. So we'll rename tcod's to `FovMap` on
import:

[source,rust]
----
use tcod::map::{Map as FovMap, FovAlgorithm};
----

The libtcod FOV module needs to know which tiles block sight. So, we
create a map that libtcod can understand, and fill it with
the appropriate values from the tiles' own `block_sight` and `blocked`
properties. Well, actually, only `block_sight` will be used; the `blocked`
value is completely irrelevant for FOV! It will be useful only for the
pathfinding module, but it doesn't hurt to provide that value anyway.
Also, libtcod asks for values that are the opposite of what we
defined, so we toggle them with the negation (`!`) operator. This goes in the
main function, before entering the main game loop.

[source,rust]
----
let mut fov_map = FovMap::new(MAP_WIDTH, MAP_HEIGHT);
for y in 0..MAP_HEIGHT {
    for x in 0..MAP_WIDTH {
        fov_map.set(x, y,
                    !map[x as usize][y as usize].block_sight,
                    !map[x as usize][y as usize].blocked);
    }
}
----

FOV needs to be recomputed -- but only if the player moves or a tile
changes. To that end, we'll keep track of player's position from the
previous run of the game loop and compare it to the current position.

Add this before the main game loop:

[source,rust]
----
let mut previous_player_position = (-1, -1);
----

(we're using `(-1, -1)` to make sure FOV gets computed on the first
time through the loop)

Then this right before `handle_keys` (which is where the player's
position could change):

[source,rust]
----
previous_player_position = (player.x, player.y);
----

And lastly, replace the existing call to `render_all` with these two lines:

[source,rust]
----
let fov_recompute = previous_player_position != (objects[0].x, objects[0].y);
render_all(&mut root, &mut con, &objects, &map, &mut fov_map, fov_recompute);
----

Now we need to change the rendering code to actually recompute FOV and
display the result. We're doing it there, because if the FOV doesn't
need to be recomputed, we don't need to render the map at all!

[source,rust]
----
if fov_recompute {
    // recompute FOV if needed (the player moved or something)
    let player = &objects[0];
    fov_map.compute_fov(player.x, player.y, TORCH_RADIUS, FOV_LIGHT_WALLS, FOV_ALGO);
}
----

As you can see, we're using all the constants we defined earlier.
Now move the code that renders the map at the end of that `if`. We'll
extend it to render the tiles in FOV with their `light` colours:

[source,rust]
----
// go through all tiles, and set their background color
for y in 0..MAP_HEIGHT {
    for x in 0..MAP_WIDTH {
        let visible = fov_map.is_in_fov(x, y);
        let wall = map[x as usize][y as usize].block_sight;
        let color = match (visible, wall) {
            // outside of field of view:
            (false, true) => COLOR_DARK_WALL,
            (false, false) => COLOR_DARK_GROUND,
            // inside fov:
            (true, true) => COLOR_LIGHT_WALL,
            (true, false) => COLOR_LIGHT_GROUND,
        };
        con.set_char_background(x, y, color, BackgroundFlag::Set);
    }
}
----

We've replaced our `if` with a `match`. As we've added another
check (whether a tile is visible or not), we would have to use nested
ifs and end up with four separate calls to `set_char_background`. But
since the only thing we're changing is the colour, we'll just pattern
match to get the right value and use it.

Finally, we'll make sure we render only objects that are in the
player's FOV. Wrap the `object.draw` call in `render_all` in a FOV
check:

[source,rust]
----
if fov_map.is_in_fov(object.x, object.y) {
    object.draw(con);
}
----

We've shuffled a lot of code around, but we haven't changed much,
conceptually. Just track whether the player moved, update FOV and
render the map if they did, use lit vs. dark colours and only render
visible objects.

And look how much better it looks now!

== Exploration

The last detail after FOV is exploration, a.k.a Fog of War. You made
it this far, so this will be a piece of cake! What, you may say, fog
of war can't possibly be the easiest thing to code in a roguelike!
Well, it is. Wait and see.

First, all tiles will store whether they're explored or not. They
start unexplored. Put this in the definition of the `Tile` struct:

[source,rust]
----
explored: bool,
----

And you need to update the `Tile::empty` and `Tile::wall` bodies:

[source,rust]
----
pub fn empty() -> Self {
    Tile{blocked: false, explored: false, block_sight: false}
}

pub fn wall() -> Self {
    Tile{blocked: true, explored: false, block_sight: true}
}
----

Now, in the `render_all` function, after the `(visible, wall)` match
make sure the visible tiles are explored and only render those that
are:

[source,rust]
----
let explored = &mut map[x as usize][y as usize].explored;
if visible {
    // since it's visible, explore it
    *explored = true;
}
if *explored {
    // show explored tiles only (any visible tile is explored already)
    con.set_char_background(x, y, color, BackgroundFlag::Set);
}
----

(we take a mutable reference to the `explored` field so we don't have
to write the full `map[x as usize][y as usize].explored` bit twice)

And finally, since we're now actually modifying the `map`, we'll need
to pass a _mutable_ reference to `render_all`.

And that's that! If you run the game now, you start in mostly black
space except for your immediate surroundings and the map fills in as
you explore.

NOTE: One might argue that that `render_all` should not actually
modify anything and that the FOV/exploration code belongs somewhere
else. They wouldn't necessarily be wrong. But let's just roll with it
for now.

Here's link:part-4b-exploration.rs.txt[the complete code so far].
