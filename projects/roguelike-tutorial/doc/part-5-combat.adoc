== Populating the dungeon

We have an explorable dungeon now. Yeah! But when you actually go
through it, it feels a bit... boring. It's just empty rooms connected
to more empty rooms. *Let's add some monsters!*

This isn't going to be as bad thanks to our object system. We create
an object for each monster and add it to the `objects` list. So all we
need to do is to create a few monsters in random locations for each
room.

Let's add a function that takes a room and does exactly that.

[source,rust]
----
fn place_objects(room: Rect, objects: &mut Vec<Object>) {
    // choose random number of monsters
    let num_monsters = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(0, MAX_ROOM_MONSTERS + 1);

    for _ in 0..num_monsters {
        // choose random spot for this monster
        let x = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(room.x1 + 1, room.x2);
        let y = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(room.y1 + 1, room.y2);

        let mut monster = if rand::random::<f32>() < 0.8 {  // 80% chance of getting an orc
            // create an orc
            Object::new(x, y, 'o', colors::DESATURATED_GREEN)
        } else {
            Object::new(x, y, 'T', colors::DARKER_GREEN)
        };

        objects.push(monster);
    }
}
----

We'll define the `MAX_ROOM_MONSTERS = 3` constant at the top of the file.

Calling `rand::random::<f32>()` will produce an `f32` number between
`0.0` and `1.0`. 80% of that is `0.8`.

As you can see, we're defining _orcs_ and _trolls_ here, but you can
do anything you want! And as we add more properties to `Object`, you
can set them all here and create any monster (or npc or item) your
heart desires.

NOTE: later on, we'll use a choice table to make the code cleaner but
for now you can just extend the `if random() ... else` block to add
more variety.

To actually place the monsters in each room, call this function right
after `create_room` in `make_map`:

[source,rust]
----
// add some content to this room, such as monsters
place_objects(new_room, objects);
----

Let's also remove the dummy NPC from the initial objects list. We
won't need it anymore.


== Getting hold of the Player's position

Before we move further, there are two things we can do to make working
with the _player_ object easier and also to get and set the position
of an object.

We've already typed `objects[0]` a few times to refer to the player.
To make it a bit clearer, we'll define a new constant `PLAYER` with
the value `0`. Put this among the other constants:

[source,rust]
----
// player will always be the first object
const PLAYER: usize = 0;
----

And now we can replace every usage of `objects[0]` with
`objects[PLAYER]`. We have a few in the `main` function and one more
in `render_all`.

It's a bit longer to type, but the intent is much clearer.

Next, add these two methods to `Object`:

[source,rust]
----
pub fn pos(&self) -> (i32, i32) {
    (self.x, self.y)
}
pub fn set_pos(&mut self, x: i32, y: i32) {
    self.x = x;
    self.y = y;
}
----

These give us a shorthand for getting or setting both coordinates (`x`
and `y`) at once. This will again simplify some code in `main`, the
`move_by` method of Object as well as setting the player's initial
position in `make_map`.


== Blocking objects

If you tried to walk up to a monster, you'd see that the player
would walk right through! That's clearly not what we want to happen in
general. Plus, we don't want multiple monsters standing on the same
tile.

But there are other options (scrolls, potions) that should not block
the tile they're on.

=== Does it block?

Let's update `Object` with information whether it blocks the player
or not. And give each object a name while we're at it. Put this in the
`Object` struct definition:

[source,rust]
----
name: String,
blocks: bool,
alive: bool,
----

And change the `new` method on `Object` to:

[source,rust]
----
pub fn new(x: i32, y: i32, char: char, name: &str, color: Color, blocks: bool) -> Self {
    Object {
        x: x,
        y: y,
        char: char,
        color: color,
        name: name.into(),
        blocks: blocks,
        alive: false,
    }
}
----

NOTE: All our objects are alive at the moment, but soon we'll add
items, scrolls, stairs, etc. and the balance will shift. Better set
things alive explicitly than turn it off. It's easy to see when you've
missed setting `alive = true` but hard to do the opposite.

Now we'll create a function that tests if a tile is blocked -- whether
due to a wall or an object blocking it.

[source,rust]
----
fn is_blocked(x: i32, y: i32, map: &Map, objects: &[Object]) -> bool {
    // first test the map tile
    if map[x as usize][y as usize].blocked {
        return true;
    }
    // now check for any blocking objects
    objects.iter().any(|object| {
        object.blocks && object.pos() == (x, y)
    })
}
----

It takes the coordinates we want to check and we must also pass in the
map and objects.

=== Ownership woes

Now we'd like to use `is_blocked` in the `move_by` method to make sure
an object never moves onto a blocked tile.

If we just put the `!is_blocked(self.x + dx, self.y + dy, map,
objects)` check into the method and add `objects` as a function
parameter, Rust will not let us use it.

The method will compile just fine, but if you try calling it in
`handle_keys`, it will not compile:

[source,rust]
----
objects[PLAYER].move_by(1, 0, &map, &objects);
----

Rust will complain that it cannot have a mutable and an immutable
borrow at once.

To guarantee memory safety and no data races, Rust's references (`&`
and `&mut`) have a few rules. One of them is that when you have a
mutable borrow, you can't have any other mutable or immutable borrows
into the same data.

And that is exactly what's happening here. The signature of the
`move_by` method is:

[source,rust]
----
fn move_by(&mut self, dx: i32, dy: i32, map: &Map, objects: &[Object])
----

We need `&Map` and `&[Object]` because they both need to be passed to
`is_blocked`. But, we also need the `&mut self` at the beginning to be
able to modify the position of the object we're moving.

And therein lies the problem, since all objects (including the one
we're calling `move_by` on) are in the `objects` vec, as soon as we
mutably borrow one part of it, Rust locks the entire vec. The line
above is essentially equivalent to this:

[source,rust]
----
let player = &mut objects[PLAYER];  // <1> <2>
let borrowed_objects = &objects;  // <3>
player.move_by(1, 0, &map, objects)  <4>
----
<1> Get a mutable borrow of the player object
<2> That will treat the whole `objects` vec as mutably borrowed
<3> Try to immutably borrow objects -- fails because it's already borrowed
<4> We don't even get here because of the double borrow issue

There's multiple ways to solve this, but the easiest is to turn the
method into a plain function and pass in the object index instead of a
reference:

[source,rust]
----
/// move by the given amount, if the destination is not blocked
fn move_by(id: usize, dx: i32, dy: i32, map: &Map, objects: &mut [Object]) {
    let (x, y) = objects[id].pos();
    if !is_blocked(x + dx, y + dy, map, objects) {
        objects[id].set_pos(x + dx, y + dy);
    }
}
----

Now we no longer have the problem, because we first get the
object's position (immutable borrow that ends immediately), then call
`is_blocked` with `objects` (again, immutable borrow that ends right
after the call) and finally, with no borrows to burden us, we set the
position.

This is what Rust people sometimes refer to as "fighting the borrow
checker". When you start with the language, you'll likely encounter a
lot of these situations. As you get more experienced, though, you'll
learn which patterns will cause trouble and structure your code
differently.

Most of the time, Rust will catch things that could result in memory
or threading issues in other languages. But sometimes (such as in our
case here), it can't tell whether the operation is okay or not and so
it rather errs on the side of safety.

You can read more in the Rust book's chapters on ownership and borrowing:

http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/references-and-borrowing.html


=== All's well

So after this interlude, the objects (including the player) can no
longer move into a tile occupied by another blocking object.

Next, make sure we don't place two blocking objects onto the same
tile. In `place_objects`, we'll check whether the tile is free before
placing a new monster:

[source,rust]
----
// only place it if the tile is not blocked
if !is_blocked(x, y, map, objects) {
    // generate the monster
}
----

And since objects have two new properties, we need to pass them along
to any code that creates one. Update the player creation to:

[source,rust]
----
let mut player = Object::new(0, 0, '@', "player", colors::WHITE, true);
player.alive = true;
----

And update the code that creates the monsters:

[source,rust]
----
// create an orc
Object::new(x, y, 'o', "orc", colors::DESATURATED_GREEN, true)

// create a troll
Object::new(x, y, 'T', "troll", colors::DARKER_GREEN, true)
----

Let's make the monsters alive as well. Right before `objects.push(monster)`:

[source]
----
monster.alive = true;
----

And in `handle_keys`, we'll change the movement code from
`player.move_by(0, -1, map)` to:

[source,rust]
----
move_by(PLAYER, 0, -1, map, objects)
----


== Player actions

Last stop before we get to the actual combat system! Our input system
has a fatal flaw: player actions (movement, combat) and other keys
(fullscreen, other options) are handled the same way. We need to
separate them. This way, if the player pauses or dies he can't move or
fight, but can press other keys. We also want to know if the player's
input means he finished his turn or not; changing to fullscreen
shouldn't count as a turn. I know they're just simple details - but
the game would be incredibly annoying without them!

Let's define high-level actions from the player that we can control
the game loop with:

[source]
----
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq)]
enum PlayerAction {
    TookTurn,
    DidntTakeTurn,
    Exit,
}
----

(deriving `PartialEq` lets us use `==` and `!=` to compare the enums together)

Change `handle_keys` to return `PlayerAction` instead of `bool`.

[source]
----
fn handle_keys(root: &mut Root, map: &Map, objects: &mut [Object]) -> PlayerAction
----

We're going to be using the enum values heavily in `handle_keys`, so
let's import them on top of the function:

[source]
----
use PlayerAction::*;
----

And then, in the code for fullscreen, return `DidntTakeTurn`:

[source]
----
Key { code: Enter, alt: true, .. } => {
    // Alt+Enter: toggle fullscreen
    let fullscreen = root.is_fullscreen();
    root.set_fullscreen(!fullscreen);
    DidntTakeTurn
}
----

Have the `Escape` code path return `Exit`:

[source]
----
Key { code: Escape, .. } => Exit,  // exit game
----

And `PlayerAction::TookTurn` to all the movement actions and
`PlayerAction::DidntTakeTurn` to the catch-all at the end.

[source]
----
Key { code: Up, .. } => {
    move_by(PLAYER, 0, -1, map, objects);
    TookTurn
}

// and so on for Down, Left and Right

_ => DidntTakeTurn,
----

This will ensure that pressing an unknown key will not do anything and
as we'll add other actions, such as picking up items, accessing
inventory, etc. we'll have an easy way of saying whether they take a
turn or not -- or even being more dynamic than that -- just opening an
inventory may not cost anything but using an item from it could.

And now let's only allow things like movement when the game is still
going on. You wouldn't want the player's corpse to walk around after
death (or maybe you would! There's a game idea.), but you may still
allow things like full screen, exiting the game or even a read-only
view into the inventory.

Let's update our match to include the `game_state`, too:

[source]
----

let player_alive = objects[PLAYER].alive;
match (key, player_alive) {
    // key handling
}
----

Now instead of just matching on keys, we have to take the game state
into consideration as well. Fullscreen and exit on Escape should work
whether the player is alive or dead, so change them to:

[source]
----
(Key { code: Enter, alt: true, .. }, _) =>   // exit
(Key { code: Escape, .. }, _) =>  // fullscreen
----

We're taking two values in a tuple `(key, player_alive)` now and
ignoring the latter.

For movement, we only want it to work when the player is alive so:

[source]
----
(Key { code: Up, .. }, true) =>  // move player
----

and so on.

NOTE: There are other ways to handle this. We could use use the `if`
syntax in the match arm (so e.g. `Key { code: Down, .. } if game_state
== Playing => // move player`) or even get rid of `match` entirely and
use if/else statements just like in Python. However, I find this
easier to read and it makes sure we never forget to handle the game
state when we add a new key.


And now we need to go back to the main loop and handle
`PlayerAction` there. Change the end of the loop to:

[source]
----
let player_action = handle_keys(&mut root, &map, &mut objects);
if player_action == PlayerAction::Exit {
    break
}
----

== Fighting orderly

This part is already running long, so we won't actually implement
combat here (that will happen in the next part), but we'll make sure
that the player and the monsters take turns to act.

[source]
----
// let monstars take their turn
if objects[PLAYER].alive && player_action != PlayerAction::DidntTakeTurn {
    for object in &objects {
        // only if object is not player
        if (object as *const _) != (&objects[PLAYER] as *const _) {
            println!("The {} growls!", object.name);
        }
    }
}
----

The `as *const _` bit is there to do a pointer comparison. Rust's
equality operators (`==` and `!=`) test for value equality, but we
haven't implemented that for `Object` and we don't care anyway -- we
just want to make sure to not process player here.

The `println!` is just the debug message. You'll see it in the console
where you write `cargo run --release` to run your game. In the next
part we'll add an AI routine to move and attack and later on an
in-game message log where we can print stuff to the player.

Right now, when a player tries to move (bump) into a monster, nothing
happens. Let's interpret that as an attack. We'll add a new function
called `player_move_or_attack` and use it instead of `move_by` in
`handle_keys`.

Replace all calls to:

[source]
----
move_by(0, -1, map, objects);
----

With:

[source]
----
player_move_or_attack(1, 0, map, objects)
----

Now let's write the function itself:

[source]
----
fn player_move_or_attack(dx: i32, dy: i32, map: &Map, objects: &mut [Object]) {
    // the coordinates the player is moving to/attacking
    let x = objects[PLAYER].x + dx;
    let y = objects[PLAYER].y + dy;

    // try to find an attackable object there
    let target_id = objects.iter().position(|object| {
        object.pos() == (x, y)
    });

    // attack if target found, move otherwise
    match target_id {
        Some(target_id) => {
            println!("The {} laughs at your puny efforts to attack him!", objects[target_id].name);
        }
        None => {
            move_by(PLAYER, dx, dy, map, objects);
        }
    }
}
----

The `position` method on an iterator runs a test on each object and as
soon as it finds one, it returns its index in the collection (in our
case a vec of `Object`).

It's possible no match will be found, so it actually returns
`Option<usize>` here.

We then test whether we have found a target at that position (in which case
we know its index), and either print out a message or just
move into that place.

And that's it! Test it out. No one's dealing any damage, but the
game now detects when you're trying to attack a monster. And you can
see the monsters taking their turns after you.

Here's link:part-5-combat.rs.txt[the complete code so far].
