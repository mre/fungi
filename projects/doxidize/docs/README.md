# Overview

Welcome to the documentation for Doxidize, a new tool for writing documentation
for your Rust projects.

Doxidize is a "documentation compiler." It takes in your code, and produces
documentation. It does this via a two step process: First, Doxidize compiles
your code to Markdown files, and then compiles that Markdown to web-based
documentation. This makes it different than `rustdoc`, the official Rust
documentation tool, which takes your source code and produces documentation
from it directly.

This project is inspired heavily by Facebook's [Docusaurus] tool. In some ways,
you can think of Doxidize as "Docusaurus for Rust," with close integration with
Rust as a language giving it the ability to have more features.

sections in the sidebar.
