== The Components

TODO: talk about composition vs. inheritance and how this isn't a real ECS whatever that means...

Our components will be plain `structs` with related bits of data and
not much else. Each `Object` will have some (or all or none) of the
components attached and that will drive their behaviour. Only things
with the `Fighter` component will be able to attack or be attacked,
for example.

Let's create the `Fighter` component. It will have hit points, maximum
hit points (for healing), defense and attack power.

[source]
----
// combat-related properties and methods (monster, player, NPC).
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq)]
struct Fighter {
    max_hp: i32,
    hp: i32,
    defense: i32,
    power: i32,
}
----

Next is the component for monster artificial intelligence. For now, it
will not carry any data, but we'll soon remedy that.

[source]
----
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq)]
struct Ai;
----

And update the `Object` definition:

[source]
----
fighter: Option<Fighter>,
ai: Option<Ai>,
----

and `Object::new`:

[source]
----
fighter: None,
ai: None,
----

This means that the newly-created objects will not have any
components. We can add them ourselves, though!

First the player:

[source]
----
player.fighter = Some(Fighter{max_hp: 30, hp: 30, defense: 2, power: 5});
----

(you'll need to make the `player` variable mutable because we're
changing it now)


And next the monsters. Each monster will get a `Fighter` component as
well as the `Ai` one. In `place_objects` where the monsters are
defined:

[source]
----
if ... {
    // create an orc
    let mut orc = Object::new(x, y, 'o', "orc", colors::DESATURATED_GREEN, true);
    orc.fighter = Some(Fighter{max_hp: 10, hp: 10, defense: 0, power: 3});
    orc.ai = Some(Ai);
    orc
} else {
    // create a troll
    let mut troll = Object::new(x, y, 'T', "troll", colors::DARKER_GREEN, true);
    troll.fighter = Some(Fighter{max_hp: 16, hp: 16, defense: 1, power: 4});
    troll.ai = Some(Ai);
    troll
}
----

== AI

We went through all this trouble and yet nothing happens? Let's fix that
by actually using our newly-minted components! The monsters have been
growling for too long and are ready to fight now.

We'll start by creating a function that will cause an object (monster,
usually) to move towards a position (the player's coordinates, usually).

[source]
----
fn move_towards(id: usize, target_x: i32, target_y: i32, map: &Map, objects: &mut [Object]) {
    // vector from this object to the target, and distance
    let dx = target_x - objects[id].x;
    let dy = target_y - objects[id].y;
    let distance = ((dx.pow(2) + dy.pow(2)) as f32).sqrt();

    // normalize it to length 1 (preserving direction), then round it and
    // convert to integer so the movement is restricted to the map grid
    let dx = (dx as f32 / distance).round() as i32;
    let dy = (dy as f32 / distance).round() as i32;
    move_by(id, dx, dy, map, objects);
}
----

Next we'll add a method on `Object` that will tell us the distance to
another object.

[source]
----
/// return the distance to another object
pub fn distance_to(&self, other: &Object) -> f32 {
    let dx = other.x - self.x;
    let dy = other.y - self.y;
    ((dx.pow(2) + dy.pow(2)) as f32).sqrt()
}
----

All right, let's use them to implement some basic behaviour: if the
monster is close, it will attack, otherwise it will move closer.

[source]
----
fn ai_take_turn(monster_id: usize, map: &Map, objects: &mut [Object], fov_map: &FovMap) {
    // a basic monster takes its turn. If you can see it, it can see you
    let (monster_x, monster_y) = objects[monster_id].pos();
    if fov_map.is_in_fov(monster_x, monster_y) {
        if objects[monster_id].distance_to(&objects[PLAYER]) >= 2.0 {
            // move towards player if far away
            let (player_x, player_y) = objects[PLAYER].pos();
            move_towards(monster_id, player_x, player_y, map, objects);
        } else if objects[PLAYER].fighter.map_or(false, |f| f.hp > 0) {
            // close enough, attack! (if the player is still alive.)
            let monster = &objects[monster_id];
            println!("The attack of the {} bounces off your shiny metal armor!", monster.name);
        }
    }
}
----

But for any of this to have effect, we need to call it from the main
loop:

[source]
----
for id in 0..objects.len() {
    if objects[id].ai.is_some() {
        ai_take_turn(id, &map, &mut objects, &fov_map);
    }
}
----

When you test it now, you can see the monsters following you around
and trying to attack you.

The whole code is available link:part-6a-ai.rs.txt[here].

== Sword-fighting

The quest for some epic medieval combat is coming to an end! We will
now write the actual functions to attack and take damage, and replace
those silly placeholders with the meaty stuff. The "meaty stuff" is
deliberately simple. This is so you can easily change it with your own
damage system, whatever it may be.

[source]
----
pub fn take_damage(&mut self, damage: i32) {
    // apply damage if possible
    if let Some(fighter) = self.fighter.as_mut() {
        if damage > 0 {
            fighter.hp -= damage;
        }
    }
}
----

In the next section we'll modify it to also handle deaths. Then
there's the method to attack another object:

[source]
----
pub fn attack(&mut self, target: &mut Object) {
    // a simple formula for attack damage
    let damage = self.fighter.map_or(0, |f| f.power) - target.fighter.map_or(0, |f| f.defense);
    if damage > 0 {
        // make the target take some damage
        println!("{} attacks {} for {} hit points.", self.name, target.name, damage);
        target.take_damage(damage);
    } else {
        println!("{} attacks {} but it has no effect!", self.name, target.name);
    }
}
----

It calls the previous method in order to handle taking damage. We
separated "attacks" and "damage" because you might want an event, like
poison or a trap, to directly damage an object by some amount, without
going through the attack damage formula.

Let's replace the dummy attack message in `ai_take_turn` with a call
to the `attack` monster.

Alas, the ownership rears its head again! If you just tried the
straightforward bit:

[source]
----
let monster = &mut objects[monster_id];
monster.attack(&mut objects[PLAYER]);
----

You would get another error about a double mutable borrow. While
taking two mutable pointers into the `objects` list is safe when
they're pointing at *different objects*, it would be a problem if they
borrowed the same one (remember, you can only have one mutable borrow
to an object at a time).

Unfortunately, Rust can't just figure out that the monster and player
are different items in the list.

However, we can let it know! There's a method on slices called
`split_at_mut` which takes an index and returns two mutable slices
split by the index. And we can use that to return a mutable borrow to
our object from both:

[source]
----
/// Mutably borrow two *separate* elements from the given slice.
/// Panics when the indexes are equal or out of bounds.
fn mut_two<T>(first_index: usize, second_index: usize, items: &mut [T]) -> (&mut T, &mut T) {
    assert!(first_index != second_index);
    let split_at_index = cmp::max(first_index, second_index);
    let (first_slice, second_slice) = items.split_at_mut(split_at_index);
    if first_index < second_index {
        (&mut first_slice[first_index], &mut second_slice[0])
    } else {
        (&mut second_slice[0], &mut first_slice[second_index])
    }
}
----

And now monster's attack looks like this:

[source]
----
// close enough, attack! (if the player is still alive.)
let (monster, player) = mut_two(monster_id, PLAYER, objects);
monster.attack(player);
----

And do the same to the player's dummy attack code in `player_move_or_attack`:

[source]
----
let (player, target) = mut_two(PLAYER, target_id, objects);
player.attack(target);
----


That's it, the player and the monsters can beat each other silly, but
no-one will die. We'll take this opportunity to print the player's HP
so you can see it plummeting to negative values as the monsters
attack you. This is how you make a simple GUI! At the end of the
`render_all` function:

[source]
----
// show the player's stats
if let Some(fighter) = objects[PLAYER].fighter {
    root.print_ex(1, SCREEN_HEIGHT - 2, BackgroundFlag::None, TextAlignment::Left,
                 format!("HP: {}/{} ", fighter.hp, fighter.max_hp));
}
----

NOTE: We render the hitpoints only when the _player_ has the `Fighter`
component. We could use `objects[PLAYER].fighter.unwrap()` instead of
`if let` here, but that would crash the game if the player ever
stopped being a fighter, which would be a shame. What if they're under
a sanctuary spell or some such?


== Untimely deaths

Of course, nobody can lose HP indefinitely. We'll now code the
inevitable demise of both the monsters and the player! This is handled
by the `Fighter` component. Since different objects have different
behaviors when killed, the `Fighter` struct must know what function to
call when the object dies. This is so that monsters leave corpses
behind, the player loses the game, the end-level boss reveals the
stairs to the next level, etc. This `on_death` callback is passed as a
parameter when creating a `Fighter` instance.

[source]
----
struct Fighter {
   // ...
   on_death: DeathCallback,
}


#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq)]
enum DeathCallback {
    Player,
    Monster,
}
----

We're adding another field to `Fighter` of a new enum `DeathCallback`.
It will represent the different "on death" functions we'll have
available.

Next, we'll add a method that will let us call the callback:

[source]
----
impl DeathCallback {
    fn callback(self, object: &mut Object) {
        use DeathCallback::*;
        let callback: fn(&mut Object) = match self {
            Player => player_death,
            Monster => monster_death,
        };
        callback(object);
    }
}
----

It checks to see which callback it represents and invokes the right
function (`player_death` or `monster_death`). The callback functions
take one parameter -- the mutable reference to the dying object. This
is so we can change its properties on death.

Before we get to writing those, lets make sure our callbacks actually
get triggered when an object dies!

We'll do that in `take_damage` rather than `attack`, because an object
may die from causes other than combat, such as a trap, hunger or
poison.

Put this at the end of the `take_damage` method:

[source]
----
// apply damage if possible
if let Some(fighter) = self.fighter.as_mut() {
    // ...
}
// check for death, call the death function
if let Some(fighter) = self.fighter {
    if fighter.hp <= 0 {
        self.alive = false;
        fighter.on_death.callback(self);
    }
}
----

The first `if let` check looks almost identical to the one that's already
there for taking the hit points down. There is a difference, however.

It boils down to ownership again. The first `if let` takes a mutable
reference to `self.fighter`. That means, for the duration of that
block, we can't take a mutable reference to `self`, because a part of it
(`fighter`) is already borrowed.

But we do need a mutable reference to pass it to the `on_death`
callback.

So while it may seem like we could just fold the callback code into
the first `if let`, we can't because it would result in the
simultaneous borrowing of `&mut Object` and `&mut Fighter`.

We do not have the same problem in the second `if let` because we _are
not borrowing `Fighter` there_. Using `self.fighter` instead of
`self.fighter.as_mut()` means we just _copy_ the `fighter` value, but
nothing is borrowed at that time. This would also mean that if we made
any changes to `fighter` in the second `if let` block, they would not
appear on the `self` Object.

As mentioned before, the ownership rules are generally a good thing
but sometimes they are a bit onerous.

Anyway, let's go implement our `player_death` and `monster_death`
callbacks!

[source]
----
fn player_death(player: &mut Object) {
    // the game ended!
    println!("You died!");

    // for added effect, transform the player into a corpse!
    player.char = '%';
    player.color = colors::DARK_RED;
}

fn monster_death(monster: &mut Object) {
    // transform it into a nasty corpse! it doesn't block, can't be
    // attacked and doesn't move
    println!("{} is dead!", monster.name);
    monster.char = '%';
    monster.color = colors::DARK_RED;
    monster.blocks = false;
    monster.fighter = None;
    monster.ai = None;
    monster.name = format!("remains of {}", monster.name);
}
----

Notice that the monster's components were disabled, so it doesn't run
any AI functions and can no longer be attacked.

To enable these behaviours, pass the `on_death` field into the
`Fighter` components wherever you've defined them. Rust will complain
if you don't so let the compiler guide you.

You can test play around with it now and you'll see that the player
and monsters stop moving when they die. There are some glitches we
need to fix, however.

First, we only want to attack an object if it has a `Fighter`
component. In `player_move_or_attack`, change the target check to the
following:

[source]
----
// try to find an attackable object there
let target_id = objects.iter().position(|object| {
    object.fighter.is_some() && object.pos() == (x, y)
});
----

`is_some` is a method on `Option` that will tell you whether it's
value is `Some(...)` without bothering you with the insides.

There's also the issue that when the player walks over a corpse, it's
sometimes drawn over the player. And the same issue happens when a
monster steps on a corpse.

We can fix both by sorting the list of objects by their `blocks`
property:

[source]
----
let mut to_draw: Vec<_> = objects.iter().collect();
// sort so that non-blocknig objects come first
to_draw.sort_by(|o1, o2| { o1.blocks.cmp(&o2.blocks) });
// draw the objects in the list
for object in &to_draw {
    if fov_map.is_in_fov(object.x, object.y) {
        object.draw(con);
    }
}
----

Instead of going through the `objects` list we clone it into a
mutable vector (`render_all` is taking `&[Object]` so it can't change
the list directly -- nor should it). Then we sort the vector such that
all non-blocking objects come before all the blocking ones. Since we can't
have two blocking objects on the same tile, this will make sure that
our player and monsters won't get overwritten by corpses.

And we can always make the logic more intricate by changing the
closure passed to `sort_by`.

One more thing, since we're only ever rendering objects that are in
the _field of view_, let's filter them out _before_ the sort. That way
we'll only sort items that we actually want to draw.

[source]
----
let mut to_draw: Vec<_> = objects.iter().filter(|o| fov_map.is_in_fov(o.x, o.y)).collect();
// sort so that non-blocknig objects come first
to_draw.sort_by(|o1, o2| { o1.blocks.cmp(&o2.blocks) });
// draw the objects in the list
for object in &to_draw {
    object.draw(con);
}
----

It's finally ready to play, and it actually feels like a game! It's been
a long journey since we first printed the `@` character, but we've got
random dungeons, FOV, exploration, enemies, AI, and a true combat
system. You can now beat those pesky monsters into a pulp and walk
over them! (_Ugh!_) See if you can finish off all of them before they do
the same to you.
