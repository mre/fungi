// The standard library provides a special trait, Deref. Itâ€™s normally used to

// https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Deref.html
// If T implements Deref<Target = U>, and x is a value of type T, then:
//  - In immutable contexts, *x on non-pointer types is equivalent
//    to *Deref::deref(&x).
//  - Values of type &T are coerced to values of type &U
//  - T implicitly implements all the (immutable) methods of the type U.

// Implicit deref coercions with functions and methods.

// When a GameState is dereferenced, the "next" function included in that
// GameState is returned.
// This will simplify the change state execution from:
//    game_state = (game_state.next)(&mut game);
// to this:
//    game_state = game_state(&mut game);
