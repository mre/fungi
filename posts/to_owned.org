* Trait std::borrow::ToOwned

#+begin_src rust
pub trait ToOwned {
    type Owned: Borrow<Self>;
    fn to_owned(&self) -> Self::Owned;

    fn clone_into(&self, target: &mut Self::Owned) { ... }
}
#+end_src

A generalization of Clone to borrowed data.

Some types make it possible to go from borrowed to owned, usually by
implementing the =Clone= trait. But =Clone= works only for going from =&T= to
=T=. The =ToOwned= trait generalizes =Clone= to construct owned data from any
borrow of a given type.

** Associated Types

type Owned: Borrow<Self>

Required Methods

#+begin_src rust
fn to_owned(&self) -> Self::Owned
#+end_src 

Creates owned data from borrowed data, usually by cloning.

Examples

Basic usage:

#+begin_src rust
let s: &str = "a";
let ss: String = s.to_owned();

let v: &[i32] = &[1, 2];
let vv: Vec<i32> = v.to_owned();
#+end_src
